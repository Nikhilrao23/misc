# Overview
From Wikipedia:

_Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues._

# Line breaks
End a line with two spaces to add a `<br/>` linebreak or add a literal newline.

## Option 1 (2 spaces)
How do I love thee?  
Let me count the ways.

## Option 2 (newline, no end spaces)
How do I love thee?

Let me count the ways.

## Using neither will not create any break:
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

# Bare URLs
The Markdown parser now supports "naked" URLs: I often visit http://example.com.

Force URLs by enclosing them in angle brackets: Have you seen <http://example.com>?

# Bold & italic
*This text will be italic*.  
_This will also be italic_.

**This text will be bold**.  
__This will also be bold__.

_You **can** combine them_ _**like so**_.

# Simple lists
- Use a minus sign for a bullet
+ Or plus sign
* Or an asterisk

# Numbered lists
1. Numbered lists are easy
2. Markdown keeps track of the numbers for you
7. So this will be item 3.
