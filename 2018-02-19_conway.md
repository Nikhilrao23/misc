I am not normally a big "game guy.""  I did have an affair with the Call of Duty franchise in early high school, but hey, who didn't?  I've never really ventured into the world of MMOs or even toyed around with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), to be honest, and my first visit to boardgamegeek.com occured ... right now.

So, it was a bit out of my element but suprisingly fun to implement Conway's Game of Life in NumPy.  I had incidentally [answered](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47372280/7954504) a Stack Overflow question related to the game a while back, but not given it much further consideration.  But upon revisting the concept, I realized it was a case perfectly built for both [subclassing a NumPy array](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.subclassing.html) and using [convolution in SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve.html).  I ended up getting _waaayyyy_ too into the whole thing and ultimately creating a rudimentary command-line interface on top of the NumPy implementation.

[Conway's Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) has an short-and-sweet list of four rules and has been popular since it was first referenced in a 1970 [article](http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html) in _Scientific American_.  The game starts with an empty board, populates a few cells, and cells resultantly grow or die based on the count of their "populated" neighbors, with the pattern morphing like a kaleidoscope.

In my approach, I used a class-based implementation that starts by subclassing NumPy's ndarray and defaulting to an array of zeros.  This syntax is a bit different than standard subclassing; there's no `super` or `__init__` overriding here.  The first method is one that simply clears the board.  (Empty spaces are zeros; populated spaces are ones; this allows us to be incredibly space-efficient with unsigned integer data types.)

```python
>>> import numpy as np

>>> class Board(np.ndarray):
...     def __new__(cls, size=15, diag=True):
...         """Initialize as a square array of zeros, shape (`size`, `size`)."""
...         obj = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=np.uint8).view(cls)
...         return obj
...
...     def clear(self, out=True):
...         """Clear (reset) the board to be empty."""
...         self[:] = 0.
...         if out:
...             return self
```

We could stop here and have a full-formed subclass:

```python
>>> board = Board(size=5)
>>> print(board)
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The class also utilizes convolution to determine each cell's "neighbor count."  The convolution of two functions f and g is evaluated with an integral transform:

Here's a quick example in sympy, solving the convolution of $f(t) = sin(t)$ and $g(t) = cos(t)$, which evaluates to $t * sin(t) / 2$.

```python
>>> import sympy as sp

>>> t, tau = sp.symbols('t tau')
>>> sol = sp.integrate(sp.sin(t - tau) * sp.cos(tau), (tau, 0, t))
>>> print(sol)
t*sin(t)/2
```
